I am currently pursuing a PhD degree in Aerospace Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"} (TAMU).  I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr. [Diego Donzis](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/ddonzis.html){:target="_blank"} in [Turbulence and Advanced Computations Lab](https://tacl.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"} since August 2016. I received my B.Tech. (Hons.) and M.Tech. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in 2016. I have also worked at GE Aviation, India, and Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore for short periods. 

My research interests are in the field of High Performance Computing (HPC), Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Turbulence, Numerical Methods and Optimization.  I am working on the development of an asynchronous numerical solver and optimal numerical schemes for highly accurate scalable simulations on next-generation exascale machines.
